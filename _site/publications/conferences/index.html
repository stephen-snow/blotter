The spectral exponent β can be interpreted as the degree of fractal characteristic which in turn makes it some sort of biomarker that gives an idea of the relative health of an individual. The prediction of the 1/fβ time series can thus prove to be an asset in the medical field where forecasting the future health state of an individual can be important for rehabilitation purposes. The goal of this paper is to consider the accuracy of several time series prediction methods such as the neural networks, regression trees and bagged regression trees learning method. To test these methods we simulate stride intervals time series as 1/fβ processes. Our results show that the regression trees can accurately predict between five and fifteen points.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#transmission-variable-tissue-paired-electrodes" class="off">K.

Electromagnetic transmission mechanisms through tissue are determined by tissue structure and associated frequency-dependent tissue properties, which are significant in the design of wireless implantable medical devices. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of varying tissue dielectric properties on maximum power transfer to a subcutaneously implanted device in a paired electrode system designed for use in proximity to metallic orthopedic implants. The transcutaneous system including external and implanted electrode pairs was simulated at several radio frequencies (125 kHz, 1 MHz, 13.56 MHz, 403 MHz, and 915 MHz) while varying the dielectric properties of the tissue medium over a range of physiological values. Maximum power transfer was calculated to represent the best-case power gain across the range of tissue properties and frequencies, and greater achievable efficiencies were seen with higher quality factor as a function of the tissue properties. The results suggest that in the paired electrode system, utilization of capacitive coupling allows the system to function in proximity to metallic surfaces such as orthopedic implants. The results also suggest that higher power gains are possible through a choice of implant location based on expected tissue properties.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#feature-compressive-sensing-swallowing-accelerometry" class="off">E.

However, it needs to be insured that signal characteristics can be recovered accurately from compressed samples. In this paper, we considered this issue by examining the effects of the number of acquired compressed samples on the calculated swallowing accelerometry signal features. We used tri-axial swallowing accelerometry signals acquired from seventeen stroke patients (106 swallows in total). From acquired signals, we extracted typically considered signal features from time, frequency and time-frequency domains. Next, we compared these features from the original signals (sampled using traditional sampling schemes) and compressively sampled signals. Our results have shown we can obtain accurate estimates of signal features even by using only a third of original samples.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#spectral-analysis-graphs-spie" class="off">I.

There are two main approaches related to the spectral transformation of graphs. The first approach is based on the Laplacian matrix. The graph Fourier transform is defined as an expansion of a graph signal in terms of eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. The calculated eigenvalues carry the notion of frequency of graph signals. The second approach is based on the graph weighted adjacency matrix, as it expands the graph signal into a basis of eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix instead of the graph Laplacian. Here, the notion of frequency is then obtained from the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or its Jordan decomposition. In this paper, advantages and drawbacks of both approaches are examined. Potential challenges and improvements to graph spectral processing methods are considered as well as the generalization of graph processing techniques in the spectral domain. Its generalization to the time-frequency domain and other potential extensions of classical signal processing concepts to graph datasets are also considered. Lastly, it is given an overview of the compressive sensing on graphs concepts.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#optimized-design-control-systems-review" class="off">J.

Lisanne Bainbridge (1983) cautioned that the more automated a system becomes, the more important it is to appropriately integrate human contributions into the system. There is no question that automated control systems provide immeasurable benefit (improved efficiency, reliability, accuracy, safety, etc.); however, this comes at a cost; loss of skill, knowledge, decision-making capability and reaction-time in our human operators. Without daily engagement in the cognitive performance-based activities required by a control system, humans become less useful to the system. There seem to be two prevailing schools of thought on the best approach to human-system interface design. One advocates automating the system as much as possible to keep the human operator out of harm’s way and to remove the error-prone human from critical operations. The other camp claims that the human operator suffers significant losses in physical capability, memory and attention capacity and their learned responses diminish in quality if they have not been actively and cognitively engaged in the operation. Then when called upon to take over control in an automated system, they are less capable of effectively operating the system manually. It is not well enough established which is correct or if there is a generalizable correct path. Currently, as automated control systems are designed, it is often the case that operators are left in the operational fringes. So, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have been exploring design methodologies that will allow system designers to understand and to then implement the best of the control system and human performance attributes, with the intent of concurrently minimizing the likelihood of human error-induced incidents. Through a series of trials using licensed reactor operators in a reconfigurable control room simulator, researchers are planning to identify and measure key performance variables while varying task configuration, level of automation, and override authority. If impact on system output is shown to be predictable, the generated model can help designers simulate various design strategies and their resulting impact on system performance, thus providing more-informed training protocols and content, more-informed simulator practice decisions and improved operational and operating procedure consistency.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cs-swallowing-accel-spie" class="off">E.

A recent contribution showed that swallowing accelerometry signals for healthy swallows and swallows indicating laryngeal penetration or tracheal aspiration have different time-frequency structures, which may be problematic for compressive sensing schemes based on time-frequency dictionaries. In this paper, we examined the effects of different swallows on the accuracy of a compressive sensing scheme based on modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences. We utilized tri-axial swallowing accelerometry signals recorded from four patients during routinely schedule videofluoroscopy exams. In particular, we considered 77 swallows approximately equally distributed between healthy swallows and swallows presenting with some penetration/aspiration. Our results indicated that the swallow type does not affect the accuracy of a considered compressive sensing scheme. Also, the results confirmed previous findings that each individual axis contributes different information. Our findings are important for further developments of a device which is to be used for long-term monitoring of swallowing difficulties.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#async-nonuniform-sampler" class="off">A.

By ignoring that the maximum frequency of their spectra is changing, uniform sampling of sparse signals collects unnecessary samples in quiescent segments of the signal. A more appropriate sampling approach would be signal–dependent. Moreover, in many of these applications power consumption and analog processing are issues of great importance that need to be considered. In this paper we present a signal dependent non–uniform sampler that uses a Modified Asynchronous Sigma Delta Modulator which consumes low–power and can be processed using analog procedures. Using Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWF) interpolation of the original signal is performed, thus giving an asynchronous analog to digital and digital to analog conversion. Stable solutions are obtained by using modulated PSWFs functions. The advantage of the adapted asynchronous sampler is that range of frequencies of the sparse signal is taken into account avoiding aliasing. Moreover, it requires saving only the zero–crossing times of the non–uniform samples, or their differences, and the reconstruction can be done using their quantized values and a PSWF–based interpolation. The range of frequencies analyzed can be changed and the sampler can be implemented as a bank of filters for unknown range of frequencies. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cs-tcd-globalsip" class="off">E.

However, monitoring maximal cerebral blood flow velocity signals for extensive time periods can generate large volumes of data for processing. In this paper, a compressive sensing (CS) approach is proposed based on a time-frequency dictionary formed by modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (MDPSS). To test the proposed scheme, we examined maximal cerebral blood flow velocity signals acquired from 20 healthy subjects during a resting state. The results of our analysis clearly depicted that these signals can be accurately reconstructed using only 30% and 50% of original samples. Hence, the proposed MDPSS-based CS approach is a valid tool for diminishing the number of acquired samples during brain-machine operations using transcranial Doppler sonography.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cs-tfr-eusipco" class="off">E.

The major problems of using existing RFID antennas at UHF band for transcutaneous operation include possible interference with pacemakers and interference with other RFID systems working at the same band. To provide a solution for the above problems, this paper uses transcutaneous near field communication (TNFC) technology based on capacitive coupling between the reader and the tag. The reader and tag both have two electrodes and the energy and signal transmission occurs with the coupling between the electrodes. Both the reader and the tag are impedance matched for maximum power transmission efficiency. A reading range of 4.1 cm is achieved through pork skin using 30 dBm power from the reader. The proposed UHF RFID system is a feasible solution to provide high efficiency for transcutaneous operation while can eliminate an interference with other medical devices or RFID devices.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#internet-of-things-medical" class="off">J.

In this paper we connect level crossing sampling with time-encoding using asynchronous sigma delta modulators, to develop an asynchronous decomposition procedure similar to the Haar transform wavelet decomposition. Our procedure provides a way to reconstruct bounded signals, not necessarily band-limited, from related zero-crossings, and it is especially applicable to decompose sparse signals in time and to denoise them.

The possibility to accurately estimate phase derivatives is important in many applications dealing with objects velocity, acceleration and acceleration rate, such as the radar applications and mechanics. The estimation approach is based on definition of the complex-lag distribution. The proposed distribution is inspired by the concepts of complex analysis theory. The general form of distribution for the estimation of the first, second and third derivative of the phase is derived from the specific individual cases. The theoretical considerations are illustrated in the example with fast varying signal phase function.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cs-heart-sounds" class="off">E.

In this paper, we propose an asynchronous signal decomposition for continuous-time signals based on scale rather than frequency. Because the implementation of the proposed procedure does not use a clock it is not affected by aliasing, and moreover no quantization is involved. Such procedure is specially applicable to biomedical signals delivering information in bursts rather than continuously. The decomposer consists of cascaded modules that expand the signal onto different resolution scales and each is composed of an asynchronous sigma delta modulator (ASDM) followed by a local averager and a lowpass filter. The ASDM is a non-linear feedback system used to represent the amplitude of a continuous-time signal by a binary signal whose zero-crossings are used to reconstruct the original signal. One of the parameters of the ASDM is used as a scaling parameter, permitting us to represent the signal by its local means –at different scales– and computed from the zerocrossing times of the output of the ASDM. We develop a compact signal representation that is described by a small number of scale parameters and contains information useful in the continuoustime processing and transmission of the data. The performance of the proposed procedure is illustrated using different types of signals. As a practical application, we consider the non-linear denoising of swallowing signals. Potentially our procedure will find application in asynchronous signal acquisition, continuoustime digital signal processing and transmission in low-power biomedical applications.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#segment-sleep-apnea" class="off">H.

Nevertheless, its performance is not always optimal and can deteriorate for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. In order to overcome these obstacles, a novel method for obtaining high resolution time-frequency representations is proposed in this paper. The new method implements proposed nonparametric snakes in order to obtain accurate locations of the signal ridges in the time-frequency domain. The results of numerical analysis show that the proposed method is capable of achieving significantly higher concentration of signals in the time-frequency domain in comparison to the spectrogram and the traditional reassignment method. Furthermore, the new scheme also maintains good performance for low SNR values, while the performance of the other two considered methods significantly diminishes. It is clear from the results that the proposed method might be of significance in applications where accurate estimation of the signal components is required for low SNR values.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#multitaper-conf" class="off">S.

If a mismatch exists, usually a larger number of bases functions is needed to achieve the same accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for channel estimation based on frames, which preserves sparsity and improves estimation accuracy. Members of the frame are formed by modulating and varying the bandwidth of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) in order to reflect various scattering scenarios. To achieve the sparsity of the proposed representation, a matching pursuit approach is employed. The estimation accuracy of the scheme is evaluated and compared with the accuracy of a Slepian basis expansion estimator based on DPSS for a variety of mobile channel parameters. The results clearly indicate that for the same number of atoms, a significantly higher estimation accuracy is achievable with the proposed scheme when compared to the DPSS estimator.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><li> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#heart-sounds-smethod" class="off">E.

The S-method is a time-frequency representation that can produce a distribution equal or close to the sum of the Wigner distributions of individual signal components. The decomposition algorithm is used for segmentation of the heart sound recordings that contain either of the two sounds: opening snap or third heart sound, which indicate distinct heart diseases. The results show that the algorithm effectively decomposes each heart beat into the corresponding components.
