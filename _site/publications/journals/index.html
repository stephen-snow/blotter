Although they are at greater risk of falls, residents of long-term care facilities, specifically residential care communities (RCCs), have been investigated much less frequently. We sought to determine the feasibility of using portable technology-based measures of balance and muscle strength (i.e., an accelerometer and a load cell) that can be used in any RCC facility. Twenty-nine subjects (age 87 ± 6 years) living in RCCs participated. An accelerometer placed on the back of the subjects measured body sway during different standing conditions. Sway in antero-posterior and mediolateral directions was calculated. Lower extremity strength was measured with a portable load cell and the within-visit reliability was determined. Assessments of grip strength, gait speed, frailty, and comorbidity were also examined. A significant increase in postural sway in both the AP and ML directions occurred as the balance conditions became more difficult due to alteration of sensory feedback (p < 0.001) or reducing the base of support (p < 0.001). There was an association between increased sway and increased frailty, more comorbidities and slower gait speed. All strength measurements were highly reliable (ICC = 0.93–0.99). An increase in lower extremity strength was associated with increased grip strength and gait speed. The portable instruments provide inexpensive ways for measuring balance and strength in the understudied RCC population, but additional studies are needed to examine their relationship with functional outcomes.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#difference-brain-networks-optimzed-vertex-frequency" class="off"><li>I.

However, it is still unknown how consecutive swallows affect brain activity. Therefore, we sought to investigate differences in swallowing brain networks formed during consecutive swallows using a signal processing on graph approach. Data were collected from 55 healthy people using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Participants performed dry swallows (i.e., saliva swallows) and wet swallows (i.e., water, nectar-thick, and honey thick swallows). After standard pre-processing of the EEG time series, brain networks were formed using the time–frequency-based synchrony measure, while signals on graphs were formed as a line graph of the brain networks. For calculating the vertex frequency information from the signals on graphs, the proposed algorithm was based on the optimized window size for calculating the windowed graph Fourier transform and the graph S-transform. The proposed algorithms were tested using synthetic signals and showed improved energy concentration in comparison to the original algorithm. When applied to EEG swallowing data, the optimized windowed graph Fourier transform and the optimized graph S-transform showed that differences exist in brain activity between consecutive swallows. In addition, the results showed higher differences between consecutive swallows for thicker liquids.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#most-suitable-mother-wavelet-gait" class="off"><li>Z.

The scaling exponent represents the fractal degree and can be interpreted as a “biomarker” of relative diseases. The previous study showed that the average wavelet method provides the most accurate results to estimate this scaling exponent when applied to stride interval time series. The purpose of this paper is to determine the most suitable mother wavelet for the average wavelet method. This paper presents a comparative numerical analysis of 16 mother wavelets using simulated and real fractal signals. Simulated fractal signals were generated under varying signal lengths and scaling exponents that indicate a range of physiologically conceivable fractal signals. The five candidates were chosen due to their good performance on the mean square error test for both short and long signals. Next, we comparatively analyzed these five mother wavelets for physiologically relevant stride time series lengths. Our analysis showed that the symlet 2 mother wavelet provides a low mean square error and low variance for long time intervals and relatively low errors for short signal lengths. It can be considered as the most suitable mother function without the burden of considering the signal length.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#implantable-doppler-flowmeters-review" class="off"><li>M.

Although wireless implantable Doppler devices are accurate for most applications, device size and implant lifetime remain vastly underdeveloped. We review past and current approaches to miniaturization and implant lifetime extension for wireless implantable Doppler devices and propose approaches to reduce device size and maximize implant lifetime for the next generation of devices. Additionally, we review current and past approaches to accurate blood flow measurements. This review points toward relying on increased levels of monolithic customization and integration to reduce size. Meanwhile, recommendations to maximize implant lifetime should include alternative sources of power, such as transcutaneous wireless power, that stand to extend lifetime indefinitely. Coupling together the results will pave the way for ultra-miniaturized totally implantable wireless blood flow monitors for truly chronic implantation.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#anatomical-directional-differences-swallowing" class="off"><li>F.

However, the displacement of the hyolaryngeal structure during the act of swallowing in patients with dysphagia involves declination of the mediallateral (M-L), which suggests that the swallowing vibrations in the M-L direction have the ability to reveal additional details about the swallowing function. With this motivation, we performed a broad comparison of the swallowing vibrations in all three anatomical directions. Tri-axial swallowing accelerometry signals were concurrently collected from 72 dysphagic patients undergoing videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing (mean age: 63.94 12.58 years period). Participants swallowed one or more thickened liquids with different consistencies including thin-thick liquids, nectar-thick liquids, and pudding-thick liquids with either a comfortable self-selected volume from a cup or a controlled volume by the examiner from a 5ml spoon. Swallows were grouped based on the viscosity of swallows and the participant’s stroke history. Then, a comprehensive set of features was extracted in multiple signal domains from 881 swallows. The results highlighted inter-axis dissimilarities among tri-axial swallowing vibrations including the extent of variability in the amplitude of signals, the degree of predictability of signals, and the extent of disordered behavior of signals in time-frequency domain. First, the upward movement of the hyolaryngeal structure, representing the S-I signals, were actually more variable in amplitude and showed less predictable behavior than the sideways and forward movements, representing the A-P and M-L signals, during swallowing. Second, the S-I signals, which represent the upward movement of the hyolaryngeal structure, behaved more disordered in the time-frequency domain than the sideways movement, M-L signals, in all groups of study except for the pudding swallows in the stroke group. Third, considering the viscosity and the participant’s pathology, thin liquid swallows in the non-stroke group presented the most directional differences among all groups of study. In summary, despite some directional dissimilarities, M-L axis accelerometry characteristics are similar to those of the two other axes. This indicates that M-L axis characteristics, which cannot be observed in videofluoroscopic images, can be adequately derived from the A-P and S-I axes.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#motor-sequence-finger-tapping" class="off"><li>H.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was measured while participants (n = 13) were asked to tap their fingers to visually presented sequences in blocks that were either the same sequence repeated (learning block) or random sequences (control block). Motor learning was associated with a decrease in brain activity during learning compared to control. Lower brain activation was noted in the posterior parietal association area and bilateral thalamus during the later periods of learning (not during the control). Compared to the control condition, we found the task-related motor learning was associated with decreased connectivity between the putamen and left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle cingulate brain regions. Motor learning was associated with changes in network activity, spatial extent, and connectivity.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#fast-vertex-frequency" class="off"><li>I.

Previously, the windowed Fourier transform had been adopted for signals on graphs and has been shown to be very useful for extracting vertex-frequency information from graphs. However, high computational complexity makes these algorithms impractical. We sought to develop a fast windowed graph Fourier transform and a fast graph S-transform requiring significantly shorter computation time. The proposed schemes have been tested with synthetic test graph signals and real graph signals derived from electroencephalography recordings made during swallowing. The results showed that the proposed schemes provide significantly lower computation time in comparison with the standard windowed graph Fourier transform and the fast graph S-transform. Also, the results showed that noise has no effect on the results of the algorithm for the fast windowed graph Fourier transform or on the graph S-transform. Finally, we showed that graphs can be reconstructed from the vertex-frequency representations obtained with the proposed algorithms.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#average-wavelet-coefficient-chaos-oscillatory-circuits" class="off"><li>V.

The algorithm is based on the wavelet transform. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed detection is developed by using a specific measure obtained by averaging wavelet coefficients. This measure exhibits various values for chaotic and periodic states. Findings: The proposed algorithm is applied to signals from autonomous systems such as the Chua’s oscillatory circuit, the Lorenz chaotic system and non-autonomous systems such as the Duffing oscillator. In addition, the detection is applied to sequences obtained from the logistic map. The results are compared to those obtained with a detrended fluctuation analysis and a time-frequency signal analysis based on detectors of chaotic states. Originality/value: In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for the detection of chaos from a single time series. The proposed technique is robust to the noise influence, having smaller calculation complexity with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques.

In this paper, we examine different machine learning approaches to use situational features associated with having or not having urges to smoke during a quit attempt in order to accurately classify high-urge states. Methods: To test our machine learning approaches, specifically, Bayes, discriminant analysis and decision tree learning methods, we used a dataset collected from over 300 participants who had initiated a quit attempt. The three classification approaches are evaluated observing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. Results: The outcome of the analysis showed that algorithms based on feature selection make it possible to obtain high classification rates with only a few features selected from the entire dataset. The classification tree method outperformed the naive Bayes and discriminant analysis methods, with an accuracy of the classifications up to 86%. These numbers suggest that machine learning may be a suitable approach to deal with smoking cessation matters, and to predict smoking urges, outlining a potential use for mobile health applications. Conclusions: In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify smoking situations, and the search for the best features and classifier parameters significantly improves the algorithms' performance. In addition, this study also supports the usefulness of new technologies in improving the effect of smoking cessation interventions, the management of time and patients by therapists, and thus the optimization of available health care resources. Future studies should focus on providing more adaptive and personalized support to people who really need it, in a minimum amount of time by developing novel expert systems capable of delivering real-time interventions.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#brain-connectivity-swallowing-different-viscosity" class="off"><li>I.

The anatomical changes caused by these therapeutic techniques are well known, but it is unclear whether these changes alter the cerebral processing of swallow-related sensorimotor activity. We sought to investigate the effect of increased fluid viscosity and chin-down posture during swallowing on brain networks. 55 healthy adults performed water, nectar-thick, and honey thick liquid swallows in the neutral and chin-tuck positions while EEG signals were recorded. After pre-processing of the EEG timeseries, the time-frequency based synchrony measure was used for forming the brain networks to investigate whether there were differences among the brain networks between the swallowing of different fluid viscosities and swallowing in different head positions. We also investigated whether swallowing under various conditions exhibit small-world properties. Results showed that fluid viscosity affects the brain network in the Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma frequency bands and that swallowing in the chin-tuck head position affects brain networks in the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma frequency bands. In addition, we showed that swallowing in all tested conditions exhibited small-world properties. Therefore, fluid viscosity and head positions should be considered in future swallowing EEG investigations.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#doppler-anastomotic-failure" class="off"><li>M.

To alleviate the problems with the current monitors, we developed a system to monitor blood flow wirelessly, with a simple and easily interpretable real-time output. To the best of our knowledge, the implanted electronics are the smallest in reported literature, which reduces bio-burden. Calibration was performed across realistic physiological flow ranges using a syringe pump. The device's sensors connected directly to the bilateral femoral veins of swine. For each 1 min, blood flow was monitored, then, an occlusion was introduced, and then, the occlusion was removed to resume flow. Each vein of four pigs was monitored four times, totaling 32 data collections. The implant measured 1.70 cm3 without battery/encapsulation. Across its calibrated range, including equipment tolerances, the relative error is less than ±5% above 8 mL/min and between -0.8% and +1.2% at its largest calibrated flow rate, which to the best of our knowledge is the lowest reported in the literature across the measured calibration range. The average standard deviation of the flow waveform amplitude was three times greater than that of no-flow. Establishing the relative amplitude for the flow and no-flow waveforms was found necessary, particularly for noise modulated Doppler signals. Its size and accuracy, compared with other microcontroller-equipped totally implantable monitors, make it a good candidate for future tether-free free flap monitoring studies.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#dual-tree-wavelet-denoising-swallowing" class="off"><li>J.

These physiological signals with low signal-to-noise ratios are traditionally denoised by well-known wavelets in a discrete, single tree wavelet decomposition. We attempt to improve this widely accepted method by designing a matched wavelet for cervical auscultation signals to provide better denoising capabilities and by implementing a dual-tree complex wavelet transform to maintain time invariant properties of this filtering. We found that our matched wavelet did offer better denoising capabilities for cervical auscultation signals compared to several popular wavelets and that the dual tree complex wavelet transform did offer better time invariance when compared to the single tree structure. We conclude that this new method of denoising cervical auscultation signals could benefit applications that can spare the required computation time and complexity.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#adaptive-power-implantable-device" class="off"><li>K.

Wireless powering of and communication with implanted devices is possible through wireless transcutaneous energy transfer. However, designing wireless transcutaneous systems is complicated due to the variability of the environment. The focus of this review is on strategies to sense and adapt to environmental variations in wireless transcutaneous systems. Adaptive systems provide the ability to maintain performance in the face of both unpredictability (variation from expected parameters) and variability (changes over time). Current strategies in adaptive (or tunable) systems include sensing relevant metrics to evaluate the function of the system in its environment and adjusting control parameters according to sensed values through the use of tunable components. Some challenges of applying adaptive designs to implantable devices are challenges common to all implantable devices, including size and power reduction on the implant, efficiency of power transfer and safety related to energy absorption in tissue. Challenges specifically associated with adaptation include choosing relevant and accessible parameters to sense and adjust, minimizing the tuning time and complexity of control, utilizing feedback from the implanted device and coordinating adaptation at the transmitter and receiver.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#aca-tcd-cognitive-tasks" class="off"><li>H.

Methods: In this study, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) was insonated on both sides, that is, right ACA (R-ACA) and left ACA (L-ACA). The envelope signals (the maximum velocity) and the raw signals were analyzed during cognitive processes, i.e. word-generation tasks, geometric tasks and resting state periods separating each task. Data which were collected from 20 healthy participants were used to investigate the changes and the hemispheric functioning while performing cognitive tasks. Signal characteristics were analyzed in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Results: Significant results have been obtained through the use of both classic/modern methods (i.e. envelope/raw, time and frequency/information-theoretic and time-frequency domains). The frequency features extracted from the raw signals highlighted sex effects on cerebral blood flow which revealed distinct brain response during each process and during resting periods. In the time-frequency analysis, the distribution of wavelet energies on the envelope signals moved around the low frequencies during mental processes and did not experience any lateralization during cognitive tasks. Conclusions: Even if no lateralization effects were noticed during resting-state, verbal and geometric tasks, understanding CBFV in ACA during cognitive tasks could complement information extracted from cerebral blood flow in middle cerebral arteries during similar cognitive tasks (i.e. sex effects).</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cervical-auscultation-unsafe-airway-protection" class="off"><li>J.

This event can lead to short-term harm via airway obstruction or more long-term effects such as pneumonia. In order to non-invasively identify this event using high resolution cervical auscultation there is a need to characterize cervical auscultation signals from subjects with dysphagia who aspirate. Methods: In this study, we collected swallowing sound and vibration data from 76 adults (50 men, 26 women, mean age 62) who underwent a routine videofluoroscopy swallowing examination. The analysis was limited to swallows of liquid with either thin (less than 5 cps) or viscous (around 300 cps) consistency and was divided into those with deep laryngeal penetration or aspiration (unsafe airway protection), and those with either shallow or no laryngeal penetration (safe airway protection), using a standardized scale. After calculating a selection of time, frequency, and time-frequency features for each swallow, the safe and unsafe categories were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical tests. Results: Our analysis found that few of our chosen features varied in magnitude between safe and unsafe swallows with thin swallows demonstrating no statistical variation. We also supported our past findings with regard to the effects of sex and the presence or absence of stroke on cervical ausculation signals, but noticed certain discrepancies with regards to bolus viscosity. Conclusions: Overall, our results support the necessity of using multiple statistical features concurrently to identify laryngeal penetration of swallowed boluses in future work with high resolution cervical auscultation.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#heart-rate-stroke-outcome" class="off"><li>A.

The secondary objective of this paper was to determine whether HRV shows a strong association with the motor outcome 3 months after stroke in individuals with severe initial motor impairments. METHODS: We recruited 13 patients with acute stroke from an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. A Holter monitor was placed upon admission and Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Subscales were used to assess the movement of the affected upper and lower extremities 3 months after admission. The standard deviation of R-R intervals was used to quantify HRV. RESULTS: A Spearman rank correlation revealed a strong positive and significant correlation between HRV upon admission and movement of the affected upper extremity (r=.70, P=.01) and affected lower extremity (r=.60, P=.03) at 3 months. For patients with severe initial motor impairments, HRV showed a strong positive association with the movement of the affected upper (r=.61, P=.04) and lower (r=.70, P=.04) extremities at 3 months. CONCLUSION: HRV is strongly associated with motor outcome after stroke and provides a promising marker to explore the mechanisms associated with motor recovery after stroke.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#menopausal-hot-flashes-and-white-matter-hyperintensities" class="off"><li>R.

Emerging data link hot flashes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet whether hot flashes are related to brain health is poorly understood. We examined the relationship between hot flashes (measured via physiologic monitor and self-report) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) among midlife women. Methods: Twenty midlife women (aged 40-60 y) without clinical CVD, with an intact uterus and ovaries, and not taking hormone therapy were recruited. Women underwent 24 hours of ambulatory physiologic and diary hot flash monitoring to quantify hot flashes; magnetic resonance imaging to assess WMH burden; 72 hours of actigraphy to quantify sleep; and a blood draw, questionnaires, and physical measures to quantify demographics and CVD risk factors. Tests of a priori hypotheses regarding relationships between physiologically monitored and self-reported wake and sleep hot flashes and WMH were conducted in linear regression models. Results: More physiologically monitored hot flashes during sleep were associated with greater WMH, controlling for age, race, and body mass index ([beta] [SE] = 0.0002 [0.0001], P = 0.03]. Findings persisted after controlling for sleep characteristics and additional CVD risk factors. No relationships were observed for self-reported hot flashes. Conclusions: More physiologically monitored hot flashes during sleep are associated with greater WMH burden among midlife women without clinical CVD. Results suggest that the relationship between hot flashes and CVD risk observed in the periphery may extend to the brain. Future work should consider the unique role of sleep hot flashes in brain health.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#extract-stride-intervals" class="off"><li>E.

However, creating the time series necessary for this analysis can be cumbersome. In particular, finding heel contact and toe-off events which define the gait cycles accurately are difficult. Method: we proposed a method to extract stride cycle events from tri-axial accelerometry signals. We validated our method via data collected from 14 healthy controls, 10 participants with Parkinson's disease, and 11 participants with peripheral neuropathy. All participants walked at self-selected comfortable and reduced speeds on a computer-controlled treadmill. Gait accelerometry signals were captured via a tri-axial accelerometer positioned over the L3 segment of the lumbar spine. Motion capture data were also collected and served as the comparison method. Results: our analysis of the accelerometry data showed that the proposed methodology was able to accurately extract heel and toe-contact events from both feet. We used t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mixed models to summarize results and make comparisons. Mean gait cycle intervals were the same as those derived from motion capture, and cycle-to-cycle variability measures were within 1.5%. Subject group differences could be similarly identified using measures with the two methods. Conclusions: a simple tri-axial acceleromter accompanied by a signal processing algorithm can be used to capture stride events. Clinical impact: the proposed algorithm enables the assessment of stride events during treadmill walking, and is the first step toward the assessment of stride events using tri-axial accelerometers in real-life settings.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#android-gait-monitor" class="off"><li>E.

In patients with subclinical physiological abnormalities, these conditions may not provide enough stress on their ability to adapt to walking. The introduction of challenging walking conditions in gait can induce responses in physiological systems in addition to the locomotor system. There is a need for a device that is capable of monitoring multiple physiological systems in various walking conditions. To address this need, an Android-based gait-monitoring device was developed that enabled the recording of a patient's physiological systems during walking. The gait-monitoring device was tested during self-regulated overground walking sessions of fifteen healthy subjects that included 6 females and 9 males aged 18–35 years. The gait-monitoring device measures the patient's stride interval, acceleration, electrocardiogram, skin conductance and respiratory rate. The data is stored on an Android phone and is analyzed offline through the extraction of features in the time, frequency and time–frequency domains. The analysis of the data depicted multisystem physiological interactions during overground walking in healthy subjects. These interactions included locomotion-electrodermal, locomotion-respiratory and cardiolocomotion couplings. The current results depicting strong interactions between the locomotion system and the other considered systems (i.e., electrodermal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems) warrant further investigation into multisystem interactions during walking, particularly in challenging walking conditions with older adults.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tcd-spinal-cord-injury" class="off"><li>H.

In this paper, we examined the consequences of upper SCI in a male participant on the cerebral blood flow velocity. In particular, transcranial Doppler was used to study these effects through middle cerebral arteries (MCA) during resting-state periods and during cognitive challenges (non-verbal word-generation tasks and geometric-rotation tasks). Signal characteristics were analyzed from raw signals and envelope signals (maximum velocity) in the time domain, the frequency domain and the time–frequency domain. The frequency features highlighted an increase of the peak frequency in L-MCA and R-MCA raw signals, which revealed stronger cerebral blood flow during geometric/verbal processes respectively. This underlined a slight dominance of the right hemisphere during word-generation periods and a slight dominance of the left hemisphere during geometric processes. This finding was confirmed by cross-correlation in the time domain and by the entropy rate in information-theoretic domain. A comparison of our results to other neurological disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury) showed that the SCI had similar effects such as general decreased cerebral blood flow and similar regular hemispheric dominance in a few cases.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#empire-ecg-rationale" class="off"><li>S.

Novel methods for real-time detection of NSTEMI would result in more immediate initiation of definitive medical therapy and faster transport to facilities that can provide specialized cardiac care. Methods: EMPIRE is an ongoing prospective, observational cohort study designed to quantify the magnitude of ischemia-induced repolarization dispersion for the early detection of NSTEMI. In this ongoing study, prehospital ECG data is gathered from patients who call 9-1-1 with a chief complaint of non-traumatic chest pain. This data is then analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique of 12-lead ECGs to fully characterize the spatial and temporal qualities of STT waveforms. Results: Between May and December of 2013, Pittsburgh EMS obtained and transmitted 351 prehospital ECGs of the 1149 patients with chest pain-related emergency dispatches transported to participating hospitals. After excluding those with poor ECG signal (n = 40, 11%) and those with pacing or LBBB (n = 50, 14%), there were 261 eligible patients (age 57 ± 16 years, 45% female, 45% Black). In this preliminary sample, there were 19 STEMI (7%) and 33 NSTEMI (12%). More than 50% of those with infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) had initially negative troponin values upon presentation. We present ECG data of such NSTEMI case that was identified correctly using our methods. Conclusions: Concrete ECG algorithms that can quantify NSTE ischemia and allow differential treatment based on such ECG changes could have an immediate clinical impact on patient outcomes.

Methods: In this study, we recorded data from 55 adult participants who each completed five saliva swallows in a chin-tuck position. The resulting data was processed using previously designed filtering and segmentation algorithms. We then calculated 9 time, frequency, and timefrequency domain features for each independent signal. Results: We found that multiple frequency and time domain features varied significantly between male and female subjects as well as between swallowing sounds and vibrations. However, our analysis showed that participant age did not play a significant role on the values of the extracted features. Finally, we found that various frequency features corresponding to swallowing vibrations did demonstrate statistically significant variation between the neutral and chin-tuck positions but sounds showed no changes between these two positions. Conclusion: The chin-tuck maneuver affects many facets of swallowing vibrations and sounds and its effects can be monitored via cervical auscultation.

This paper provides a review of the existing literature which has deployed EEG in the investigation of oropharyngeal swallowing, smell, taste and texture related to swallowing, cortical pre-motor activation in swallowing, and swallowing motor imagery detection. Furthermore, this paper provides a brief review of the different modalities of brain imaging techniques used to study swallowing brain activities, as well as the EEG components of interest for studies on swallowing and on swallowing motor imagery.

Both cerebral blood flow velocity and gait characteristics of eleven participants with no history of brain or gait conditions were recorded using transcranial Doppler on mid-cerebral artery while on a treadmill. The cognitive task was induced by a backward counting starting from 10,000 with decrement of 7. Central blood flow velocity raw and envelope features were extracted in both time, frequency and time-scale domain; information-theoretic metrics were also extracted and statistical significances were inspected. A similar feature extraction was performed on the stride interval signal. Statistical differences between the cognitive and baseline trials, between the left and right mid-cerebral arteries signals and the impact of the antropometric variables where studied using linear mixed models. No statistical differences were found between the left and right mid-cerebral arteries flows or the baseline and cognitive state gait features, while statistical differences for specific features were measured between cognitive and baseline states. These statistical differences found between the baseline and cognitive states show that cognitive process has an impact on the cerebral activity during walking. The state was found to have an impact on the correlation between the gait and blood flow features.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#new-paradigm-passive-rfid" class="off"><li>L.

The eventual goal of the field is to improve the effectiveness of screening algorithms designed to predict the risk that swallowing disorders pose to individual patients’ health and safety. This paper provides an overview of these signal-processing techniques and summarizes recent advances made with digital transducers in hopes of organizing the highly varied research on cervical auscultation. It investigates where on the body these transducers are placed in order to record a signal as well as the collection of analog and digital filtering techniques used to further improve the signal quality. It also presents the wide array of methods and features used to characterize these signals, ranging from simply counting the number of swallows that occur over a period of time to calculating various descriptive features in the time, frequency, and phase space domains. Finally, this paper presents the algorithms that have been used to classify these data into “normal” and “abnormal” categories. Both linear as well as nonlinear techniques are presented in this regard.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#brain-networks-different-head-positions-saliva-swallowing" class="off"><li>I.

The resting state is usually characterized by using the mean velocity or the maximum Doppler shift frequency (an envelope signal) by insonating the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). In this study, we characterized the cerebral blood ow in the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs). We analyzed both the envelope signals and the raw signals obtained from bilateral insonation. We recruited 20 healthy subjects and conducted the data acquisition for 15 minutes. Features were extracted from the time domain, the frequency domain and the time-frequency domain. The results showed that gender-based statistical dierence exists in the frequency domain and the time-frequency domain. However, no handedness eect was found. In the time domain, the information-theoretic features showed that the mutual dependence is higher in raw signals than in envelope signals. Finally, we concluded that insonating the ACA will serve as a complement of the MCA studies. Additionally, the investigation of the raw signals provided us with additional information that is not otherwise available from the envelope signals. The direct TCD raw-data utilization is therefore validated as a valuable resting-state characterization method.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#human-nonhuman-spinal-cord-injury" class="off"><li>N.

In previous experiments, it has been demonstrated that a transmitter can be implanted in the macaque fasicularis monkey that measures electromyographic data from the musculature of the tail. As well, previous experiments have demonstrated that selective lesions can be created in the lower thoracic spinal cord that does not cause limb weakness and/or bowel dysfunction. The histopathological features of these lesions appear similar to human TSCI.

Previous contributions have adopted various pre-processing approaches for gait accelerometry signals, but none have thoroughly investigated the effects of such pre-processing operations on the obtained results. Therefore, this paper investigated the influence of pre-processing operations on signal features extracted from gait accelerometry signals. These signals were collected from 35 participants aged over 65 years: 14 of them were healthy controls (HC), 10 had Parkinson׳s disease (PD) and 11 had peripheral neuropathy (PN). The participants walked on a treadmill at preferred speed. Signal features in time, frequency and time–frequency domains were computed for both raw and pre-processed signals. The pre-processing stage consisted of applying tilt correction and denoising operations to acquired signals. We first examined the effects of these operations separately, followed by the investigation of their joint effects. Several important observations were made based on the obtained results. First, the denoising operation alone had almost no effects in comparison to the trends observed in the raw data. Second, the tilt correction affected the reported results to a certain degree, which could lead to a better discrimination between groups. Third, the combination of the two pre-processing operations yielded similar trends as the tilt correction alone. These results indicated that while gait accelerometry is a valuable approach for the gait assessment, one has to carefully adopt any pre-processing steps as they alter the observed findings.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#menopausal-default-mode-network" class="off"><li>R.

We particularly focus on DMN networks supporting the hippocampus as this region is rich in estrogen (E) receptors (ER) and has previously been linked to hot flashes. Design: Women underwent 24 hours of physiologic and diary hot flash monitoring, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 72 hours of sleep actigraphy monitoring, a blood draw, questionnaires, and physical measures. Setting: University medical center. Patients: Twenty midlife women aged 40–60 years who had their uterus and both ovaries and were not taking hormone therapy (HT). Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measure(s): The DMN functional connectivity. Results: Controlling for age, race, and education, more physiologically-monitored hot flashes were associated with greater DMN connectivity (beta, B [SE] = 0.004 [0.002]), particularly hippocampal DMN connectivity (B [SE] = 0.005 [0.002]). Findings were most pronounced for sleep physiologic hot flashes (with hippocampal DMN, B [SE] = 0.02 [0.007]). Associations also persisted controlling for sleep, depressive symptoms, and serum E2 concentrations. Conclusions: More physiologically-monitored hot flashes were associated with more DMN connectivity, particularly networks supporting the hippocampus.

To be clinically useful without human involvement, any devices based on cervical auscultation should be able to detect specified swallowing events in an automatic manner. Methods: In this paper, we comparatively analyze the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN), a k-means based algorithm, and an algorithm based on quadratic variation as methods of differentiating periods of swallowing activity from periods of time without swallows. These algorithms utilized swallowing vibration data exclusively and compared the results to a gold standard measure of swallowing duration. Data was collected from 23 subjects that were actively suffering from swallowing difficulties. Results: Comparing the performance of the DBSCAN algorithm with a proven segmentation algorithm that utilizes k-means clustering demonstrated that the DBSCAN algorithm had a higher sensitivity and correctly segmented more swallows. Comparing its performance with a threshold-based algorithm that utilized the quadratic variation of the signal showed that the DBSCAN algorithm offered no direct increase in performance. However, it offered several other benefits including a faster run time and more consistent performance between patients. All algorithms showed noticeable differentiation from the endpoints provided by a videofluoroscopy examination as well as reduced sensitivity. Conclusions: In summary, we showed that the DBSCAN algorithm is a viable method for detecting the occurrence of a swallowing event using cervical auscultation signals, but significant work must be done to improve its performance before it can be implemented in an unsupervised manner.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#students-big-medical-data" class="off"><li>E.

The differences between these techniques and the information they capture about swallowing have not previously been explored in a direct comparison. Methods: In this study, we investigated the differences between dual-axis swallowing accelerometry and swallowing sounds by recording data from adult participants and calculating a number of time and frequency domain features. During the experiment, 55 participants (ages 18-65) were asked to complete five saliva swallows in a neutral head position. The resulting data was processed using previously designed techniques including wavelet denoising, spline filtering, and fuzzy means segmentation. The pre-processed signals were then used to calculate 9 time, frequency, and timefrequency domain features for each independent signal. Wilcoxon signed-rank and Wilcoxon ranksum tests were utilized to compare feature values across transducers and patient demographics, respectively. Results: In addition to finding a number of features that varied between male and female participants, our statistical analysis determined that the majority of our chosen features were statistically significantly different across the two sensor methods and that the dependence on within-subject factors varied with the transducer type. However, a regression analysis showed that age accounted for an insignificant amount of variation in our signals. Conclusions: We conclude that swallowing accelerometry and swallowing sounds provide different information about deglutition despite utilizing similar transduction methods. This contradicts past assumptions in the field and necessitates the development of separate analysis and processing techniques for swallowing sounds and vibrations.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#wireless-communications-oil-gas-wells" class="off"><li>N.

While it is well known that EEG signals are non-stationary, there are still open questions regarding the stationarity of EEG during swallowing activities and how the EEG stationarity is affected by different viscosities of the fluids that are swallowed by subjects during these swallowing activities. In the present study, we investigated the EEG signal collected during swallowing tasks by collecting data from 55 healthy adults (ages 18-65). Each task involved the deliberate swallowing of boluses of fluids of different viscosities. Using time-frequency tests with surrogates, we showed that the EEG during swallowing tasks could be considered non-stationary. Furthermore, the statistical tests and linear regression showed that the parameters of fluid viscosity, sex, and different brain regions significantly influenced the index of non-stationarity values. Therefore, these parameters should be considered in future investigations which use EEG during swallowing activities.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#wireless-venous-flow-monitoring" class="off"><li>J.

Most recently, it has been hypothesized that these dynamics may be necessary for gait efficiency although the supporting evidence to date is scant. The current study examines over-ground SI dynamics, and their relationship with the cost of walking and physical activity levels in neurologically healthy children aged nine to 15 years. Twenty participants completed a single experimental session consisting of three phases: 10 minutes resting, 15 minutes walking and 10 minutes recovery. The scaling exponent (alpha) was used to characterize SI dynamics while net energy cost was measured using a portable metabolic cart, and physical activity levels were determined based on a 7-day recall questionnaire. No significant linear relationships were found between alpha and the net energy cost measures (r<0.07; p>0.25) or between alpha and physical activity levels (r=0.01, p=0.62). However, there was a marked reduction in the variance of alpha as activity levels increased. Over-ground stride dynamics do not appear to directly reflect energy conservation of gait in neurologically healthy youth. However, the reduction in the variance of alpha with increasing physical activity suggests a potential exercise-moderated convergence towards a level of stride interval persistence for able-bodied youth reported in the literature. This latter finding warrants further investigation.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mca-rest-cognitive" class="off"><li>M.

Our objectives were: 1) to determine, from an original study in older community-dwellers without diagnosis of dementia, which gait parameters, among slower gait speed, higher stride time variability (STV) and Timed Up & Go test (TUG) delta time, were most strongly associated with lower performance in two cognitive domains (i.e., episodic memory and executive function); and 2) to quantitatively synthesize, with a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association between gait performance and cognitive decline (i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia). Based on a cross-sectional design, 934 older community-dwellers without dementia (mean±standard deviation, 70.3±4.9years; 52.1% female) were recruited. A score at 5 on the Short Mini-Mental State Examination defined low episodic memory performance. Low executive performance was defined by clock-drawing test errors. STV and gait speed were measured using GAITRite system. TUG delta time was calculated as the difference between the times needed to perform and to imagine the TUG. Then, a systematic Medline search was conducted in November 2013 using the Medical Subject Heading terms "Delirium," "Dementia," "Amnestic," "Cognitive disorders" combined with "Gait" OR "Gait disorders, Neurologic" and "Variability." A total of 294 (31.5%) participants presented decline in cognitive performance. Higher STV, higher TUG delta time, and slower gait speed were associated with decline in episodic memory and executive performances (all P-values <0.001). The highest magnitude of association was found for higher STV (effect size = −0.74 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): −1.05;−0.43], among participants combining of decline in episodic memory and in executive performances). Meta-analysis underscored that higher STV represented a gait biomarker in patients with MCI (effect size = 0.48 [95% CI: 0.30;0.65]) and dementia (effect size = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.40;1.72]).

Modifying the model for the ASDM, we obtain a recursive equation that permits to obtain the non–uniform samples from the zero–time crossing values. Latticing the joint time–frequency space into defined frequency bands, and time windows depending on the scale parameter different decompositions, similar to wavelet decompositions, are possible. We present two cascade low– and high–frequency decomposers, and a bank–of–filters parallel decomposer. This last decomposer using the modified ASDM behaves like a asynchronous analog to digital converter, and using an interpolator based on Prolate Spheroidal Wave functions allows reconstruction of the original signal. The asynchronous approaches proposed here are well suited for processing signals sparse in time, and for low–power applications. The different approaches are illustrated using synthetic and actual signals.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#implantable-doppler-cs" class="off"><li>E.

In order to recover the lost samples, we considered approaches based on recently proposed compressive sensing. In this paper, we carried out a comparative analysis of several different approaches using synthetic signals and real signals obtained during blood flow monitoring in four pigs. We considered three different basis functions: Fourier basis, discrete prolate spheroidal sequences and modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences. To avoid the computational burden, we considered approaches based on the $l_1$ minimization for all three bases. To understand the trade-off between the computational complexity and the accuracy, we also used a recovery process based on matching pursuit and modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences bases. For both synthetic and real signals, the matching approach with modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences provided the most accurate results. Future studies should focus on the optimization of the modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences in order to further decrease the computational complexity and increase the accuracy.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#comprehensive-gait-assessment" class="off"><li>E.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive set of signal features that may be used to extract clinically valuable information from gait accelerometry signals. To achieve our goal, we collected tri-axial gait accelerometry signals from 35 adults 65 years of age and older. Fourteen subjects were healthy controls, ten participants were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and eleven participants were diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy. The data were collected while the participants walked on a treadmill at a preferred walking speed. Accelerometer signal features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains were extracted. The results of our analysis showed that some of the extracted features were able to differentiate between healthy and clinical populations. Signal features in all three domains were able to emphasize variability among different groups, and also revealed valuable information about variability of the signals between anterior-posterior, mediolateral and vertical directions within subjects. The current results imply that the proposed signal features can be valuable tools for the analysis of gait accelerometry data and should be utilized in future studies.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#motor-imagery-gait" class="off"><li>O.

Methods: Sixty-six participants (24 CHI, 23 individuals with MCI, and 19 individuals with ADRD) were recruited in this cross-sectional study. The mean and standard deviation of the pTUG and iTUG completion times and the TUG delta time, as well as age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were used as outcomes. Participants were separated into three groups based on the tertilization of TUG delta time: lowest (<13.6%; n = 22; best performance), intermediate (13.6-52.2%; n = 22), and highest tertile (>52.2%; n = 22, worst performance). Results: Fewer CHI were in the group exhibiting the highest tertile of TUG delta time compared to individuals with lowest and intermediate TUG delta times (p = 0.013). Being in the highest tertile of the TUG delta time was associated with cognitive decline in the unadjusted model (p = 0.012 for MCI, and p = 0.021 for mild-to-moderate ADRD). In the multivariate models, this association remained significant only for individuals with MCI (p = 0.019 while adjusting for age and gender; p = 0.047 while adjusting for age, gender, and MMSE score; p = 0.012 for the stepwise backward model). Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence that motor imagery of gait may be used as a biomarker of MCI in older adults.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stationarity-fmri-foot-tapping" class="off"><li>O.

To utilize advanced analysis methods such as graph theory for these investigations, the stationarity of fMRI time series needs to be understood as it has important implications on the choice of appropriate approaches for the analysis of complex brain networks. In this paper, we investigated the stationarity of fMRI time series acquired from twelve healthy participants while they performed a motor (foot tapping sequence) learning task. Since prior studies have documented that learning is associated with systematic changes in brain activation, a sequence learning task is an optimal paradigm to assess the degree of non-stationarity in fMRI time-series in clinically relevant brain areas. We predicted that brain regions involved in a "learning network" would demonstrate non-stationarity and may violate assumptions associated with some advanced analysis approaches. Six blocks of learning, and six control blocks of a foot tapping sequence were performed in a fixed order. The reverse arrangement test was utilized to investigate the time series stationarity. Our analysis showed some non-stationary signals with a time varying first moment as a major source of non-stationarity. We also demonstrated a decreased number of non-stationarities in the third block as a result of priming and repetition. The implication of our findings is that future investigations analyzing complex brain networks should utilize approaches robust to non-stationarities, as graph-theoretical approaches can be sensitive to non-stationarities present in data.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#carbon-nanotubes-ph" class="off"><li>P.

Herein, we describe a solid-state sensor based on oxidized single-walled carbon nanotubes (ox-SWNTs) functionalized with the conductive polymer poly(1-aminoanthracene) (PAA). This device had a Nernstian response over a wide pH range (2–12) and retained sensitivity over 120 days. The sensor was also attached to a passively-powered radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag which transmits pH data through simulated skin.

The scaling exponent beta is thus often interpreted as a ``biomarker'' of relative health and decline. New Method: This paper presents a thorough comparative numerical analysis of fractal characterization techniques with specific consideration given to experimentally measured gait stride interval time series. The ideal fractal signals generated in the numerical analysis are constrained under varying lengths and biases indicative of a range of physiologically conceivable fractal signals. This analysis is to complement previous investigations of fractal characteristics in healthy and pathological gait stride interval time series, with which this study is compared. Results: The results of our analysis showed that the averaged wavelet coefficient method consistently yielded the most accurate results. Comparison with Existing Methods: Class dependent methods proved to be unsuitable for physiological time series. Detrended fluctuation analysis as most prevailing method in the literature exhibited large estimation variances. Conclusions: The comparative numerical analysis and experimental applications provide a thorough basis for determining an appropriate and robust method for measuring and comparing a physiologically meaningful biomarker, the spectral index $\beta$. In consideration of the constraints of application, we note the significant drawbacks of detrended fluctuation analysis and conclude that the averaged wavelet coefficient method can provide reasonable consistency and accuracy for characterizing these fractal time series.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#aca-resting" class="off"><li>H.

The resting state is usually characterized by using the mean velocity or the maximum Doppler shift frequency (an envelope signal) by insonating the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). In this study, we characterized the cerebral blood ow in the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs). We analyzed both the envelope signals and the raw signals obtained from bilateral insonation. We recruited 20 healthy subjects and conducted the data acquisition for 15 minutes. Features were extracted from the time domain, the frequency domain and the time-frequency domain. The results showed that gender-based statistical dierence exists in the frequency domain and the time-frequency domain. However, no handedness eect was found. In the time domain, the information-theoretic features showed that the mutual dependence is higher in raw signals than in envelope signals. Finally, we concluded that insonating the ACA will serve as a complement of the MCA studies. Additionally, the investigation of the raw signals provided us with additional information that is not otherwise available from the envelope signals. The direct TCD raw-data utilization is therefore validated as a valuable resting-state characterization method.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#swallowing-sounds-different-fluids" class="off"><li>I.

While the effects of fluid viscosity on swallowing accelerometry signals is well understood, there are still open questions about these effects on swallowing sounds. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of fluids with increasing thickness on swallowing sound characteristics. Method: We collected swallowing sounds and swallowing accelerometry signals from 56 healthy participants. Each participant completed five water swallows, five swallows of nectar-thick apple juice, and five swallows of honey-thick apple juice. These swallows were completed in neutral head and chin-tuck head positions. After pre-processing of collected signals, a number of features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains were extracted. Results: Our numerical analysis demonstrated that significant influence of viscosity was found in most of the features. In general, features extracted from swallows in the neutral head position were affected more than swallows from the chin-tuck position. Furthermore, most of the differences were found between water and fluids with higher viscosity. Almost no significant differences were found between swallows involving nectar-thick and honey-thick apple juices. Our results also showed that thicker fluids had higher acoustic regularity and predictability as demonstrated by the information-theoretic features, and a lower frequency content as demonstrated by features in the frequency domain. Conclusions: According to these results, we can conclude that viscosity of fluids should be considered in future investigations involving swallowing sounds.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#async-tfr" class="off"><li>L.

Therefore, signals from practical applications which are realizations of non–stationary processes are difficult to represent and to process. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the asynchronous representation and processing of non–stationary signals using a time-frequency framework. Power consumption and type of processing imposed by the size of the devices in many applications motivate the use of asynchronous, rather than conventional synchronous, approaches. This leads to the consideration of non–uniform, signal–dependent level–crossing and asynchronous sigma delta modulator (ASDM) based sampling. Reconstruction from a non– uniform sampled signal is made possible by connecting the sinc and the Prolate Spheroidal Wave (PSW) functions — a more appropriate basis. Two decomposition procedures are considered. One is based on the ASDM that generalizes the Haar wavelet representation and is used for representing analog non–stationary signals. The second decomposer is for representing discrete non– stationary signals. It is based on a linear-chirp based transform that provides local time-frequency parametric representations based on linear chirps as intrinsic mode functions. Important applications of these procedures are the compression and processing of biomedical signals as it will be illustrated.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#sci-model" class="off"><li>J.

In the second part, we observed fifteen able-bodied adults as they walked on a treadmill for 15 min while watching (1) TV with sound (2) TV without sound and (3) TV with subtitles but no sound. Gait timing was recorded via bilateral heel sensors and center-of-mass accelerations were measured by tri-axial accelerometers. Measures of statistical persistence, dynamic stability and gait variability were calculated. Our results showed that none of the considered gait measures were statistically different when comparing music with no-music trials. Therefore, walking to music did not appear to affect intrinsic walking dynamics in the able-bodied adult population. However, stride interval variability and stride interval dynamics were significantly greater in the TV with sound walking condition when compared to the TV with subtitles condition. Treadmill walking while watching TV with subtitles alters intrinsic gait dynamics but potentially offers greater gait stability.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#eeg-stationarity-swallowing" class="off"><li>I.

Understanding these complex interactions is of great interest from both a scientific and a clinical perspective. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to study brain functional networks during voluntary saliva swallowing in twenty-two adult healthy subjects (all females, 23.1 plus\minus 1.52 years of age). To construct these functional connections, we computed mean partial correlation matrices over ninety brain regions for each participant. Two regions were determined to be functionally connected if their correlation was above a certain threshold. These correlation matrices were then analyzed using graph-theoretical approaches. In particular, we considered several network measures for the whole brain and for swallowing-related brain regions. The results have shown that significant pairwise functional connections were, mostly, either local and intra-hemispheric or symmetrically inter-hemispheric. Furthermore, we showed that all human brain functional network, although varying in some degree, had typical small-world properties as compared to regular networks and random networks. These properties allow information transfer within the network at a relatively high efficiency. Swallowing-related brain regions also had higher values for some of the network measures in comparison to when these measures were calculated for the whole brain. The current results warrant further investigation of graph-theoretical approaches as a potential tool for understanding the neural basis of dysphagia.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#noise-in-medicine-and-physio" class="off"><li>E.

The proposed algorithm is based on the wavelet packet decomposition of swallowing accelerometry signals in combination with linear discriminant analysis as a feature reduction method and Bayes classification. The proposed algorithm was tested using swallowing accelerometry signals collected from 40 patients during the regularly scheduled videoflouroscopy exam. The participants were instructed to swallow several five milliliter sips of thin liquid barium in a head neutral position. The results of our numerical analysis showed that the proposed algorithm can differentiate healthy swallows from aspiration swallows with an accuracy greater than 90\%.

This facilitates the placement of a selective lesion that partially disconnects the upper and lower motor neuron supply to the musculature of the tail. An implanted transmitter quantitatively measures electomyographic data from the tail. The preliminary data indicates that this model is feasible.

Valid, reliable tools for detecting aspiration during clinical screening and assessment are needed. In this study, we investigated the validity of a noninvasive accelerometry signal processing classifier for detecting aspiration. Dual-axis cervical accelerometry signals were collected from 40 adults on thin-liquid swallowing tasks during videofluoroscopic swallowing examinations. Signal processing algorithms were used to remove known sources of artifact and a classifier was trained to identify signals associated with penetration-aspiration. Validity was measured in comparison to blinded ratings of penetration-aspiration from the concurrently recorded videofluoroscopies. On a bolus-by-bolus basis, the accelerometry classifier had a 10% false negative rate (90% sensitivity) and a 23% false positive rate (77% specificity) for detecting penetrationaspiration.

Its resting-state characteristics are known only when considering the maximal velocity corresponding to the highest Doppler shift (so called the envelope signals). Significantly more information about the resting-state fTCD can be gained when considering the raw cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) recordings. In this paper, we considered simultaneously acquired envelope and raw CBFV signals. Specifically, we collected bilateral CBFV recordings from left and right middle cerebral arteries using 20 healthy subjects (10 females). The data collection lasted for 15 minutes. The subjects were asked to remain awake, stay silent, and try to remain thought-free during the data collection. Time, frequency and time-frequency features were extracted from both the raw and the envelope CBFV signals. The effects of age, sex and body-mass index were examined on the extracted features. The results showed that the raw CBFV signals had a higher frequency content, and its temporal structures were almost uncorrelated. The information-theoretic features showed that the raw recordings from left and right middle cerebral arteries had higher content of mutual information than the envelope signals. Age and body-mass index did not have statistically significant effects on the extracted features. Sex-based differences were observed in all three domains and for both, the envelope signals and the raw CBFV signals. These findings indicate that the raw CBFV signals provide valuable information about the cerebral blood flow which can be utilized in further validation of fTCD as a clinical tool.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#chaotic-circuits-dfa" class="off"><li>I.

Thirteen participants were perturbed at the level of the sternum, in eight directions during sitting. Electromyographic (EMG) responses of ten trunk muscles involved in postural control were recorded. The SOM was used to encode the EMG responses on a two-dimensional (2-D) projection (i.e., visualization). The result contains similar patterns mapped close together on the plot therefore forming clusters of data. Such visualization of ten EMG responses following eight directional perturbations allows comparisons of direction-dependent postural synergies. Direction-dependent neuromuscular response models for each muscle was then constructed from the SOM visualization. The results demonstrate that SOM was able to encode complex neuromuscular responses and the visualization shows direction-dependent differences in the postural synergies. Moreover, each muscle was modelled using the SOM-based method and shows that all muscles, except one, produce a Gaussian fit for direction-dependent responses which is supported in the literature. Overall, SOM analysis offers a reverse engineering method for exploration and comparison of complex neuromuscular systems, which can describe postural synergies at a glance.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#different-cues-and-gait" class="off"><li>E.

However, natural gait rhythms can be influenced by metronomic auditory stimuli, a phenomenon of particular interest in neurological rehabilitation. In this paper, we examined the effects of aural, visual and tactile rhythmic cues on the temporal dynamics associated with human gait. Data were collected from fifteen healthy adults in two sessions. Each session consisted of five 15-minute trials. In the first trial of each session, participants walked at their preferred walking speed. In subsequent trials, participants were asked to walk to a metronomic beat, provided through visually, aurally, tactile or all three cues (simultaneously and in sync), the pace of which was set to the preferred walking speed of the first trial. Using the collected data, we extracted several parameters including: gait speed, mean stride interval, stride interval variability, scaling exponent and maximum Lyapunov exponent. The extracted parameters showed that rhythmic sensory cues affect the temporal dynamics of human gait. The auditory rhythmic cue had the greatest influence on the gait parameters, while the visual cue had no statistically significant effect on the scaling exponent. These results demonstrate that visual rhythmic cues could be considered as an alternative cueing modality in rehabilitation without concern of adversely altering the statistical persistence of walking.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#kids-classifier-swallowing" class="off"><li>C.

The gold standard of dysphagia detection is videofluoroscopy which exposes the child to ionizing radiation, and requires specialized clinical expertise and expensive institutionally-based equipment, precluding day-to-day and repeated assessment of fluctuating swallowing function. Swallowing accelerometry is the non-invasive measurement of cervical vibrations during swallowing and may provide a portable and cost-efective bedside alternative. In particular, dual-axis swallowing accelerometry has demonstrated screening potential in older persons with neurogenic dysphagia, but the technique has not been evaluated in the pediatric population. Methods: In this study, dual-axis accelerometric signals were collected simultaneous to video fluoroscopic records from 29 pediatric participants (age 6.8 plus/minus 4.8 years; 20 males) previously diagnosed with neurogenic dysphagia. Participants swallowed 3-5 sips of barium-coated boluses of different consistencies (normally, from thick puree to thin liquid) by spoon or bottle. Videofluoroscopic records were reviewed retrospectively by a clinical expert to extract swallow timings and ratings. The dual-axis acceleration signals corresponding to each identified swallow were pre-processed, segmented and trimmed prior to feature extraction from time, frequency, time-frequency and information theoretic domains. Feature space dimensionality was reduced via principal components. Results: Using 8-fold cross-validation, 16-17 dimensions and a support vector machine classifier with an RBF kernel, an adjusted accuracy of 89.6% plus\minus 0.9 was achieved for the discrimination between swallows with and with out airway entry. Conclusions: Our results suggest that dual-axis accelerometry has merit in the non-invasive detection of unsafe swallows in children and deserves further consideration as a pediatric medical device.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stride-interval-stationarity-music-tv" class="off"><li>E.

A fundamental temporal characteristic of ambulation is the temporal fluctuation of the stride interval. In this paper, we investigate the stationarity of stride interval time series when people are exposed to different forms of auditory and visual distractions. An increase in nonstationary behavior may be suggestive of divided attention and more frequent central modulation of locomotion, both of which may have ramifications on pedestrian vigilance and responsiveness to environmental perturbations. One group of fifteen able-bodied (6 females) young adult participants completed a music protocol (overground walking with and without music). A second group of fifteen (7 females) did a television protocol (treadmill walking while watching TV with and without sound). Three walking trials, each 15 minutes in duration, were performed at each participant's comfortable walking speed, with force sensitive resistors under the heel of each foot. Using the reverse arrangements test, the vast majority of time series were nonstationary, with a time-varying mean as the principal source of nonstationarity. Furthermore, the television trial with sound had the greatest number of nonstationarities followed by overground walking while listening to music. We discuss the possibility that these conditions measurably affect gait dynamics through a subconscious synchronization to external rhythms or a cyclic distraction followed by a period of increased conscious correction of gait timing. Our findings suggest that the regulation of stride timing is particularly susceptible to constant, time-evolving auditory stimuli, but that normal pacing can be restored quickly upon stimulus withdrawal. These kinds of sensory distractions should thus be carefully considered in studies of pedestrian ambulation.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#CS-using-MDPSS" class="off"><li>E.

In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) algorithm to alleviate some of these issues while acquiring dual-axis swallowing accelerometry signals. The proposed CS approach uses a time-frequency dictionary where the members are modulated discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (MDPSS). These waveforms are obtained by modulation and variation of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) in order to reflect the time-varying nature of swallowing acclerometry signals. While the modulated bases permit one to represent the signal behavior accurately, the matching pursuit algorithm is adopted to iteratively decompose the signals into an expansion of the dictionary bases. To test the accuracy of the proposed scheme, we carried out several numerical experiments with synthetic test signals and dual-axis swallowing accelerometry signals. In both cases, the proposed CS approach based on the MDPSS yields more accurate representations than the CS approach based on DPSS. Specifically, we show that dual-axis swallowing accelerometry signals can be accurately reconstructed even when the sampling rate is reduced to half of the Nyquist rate. The results clearly indicate that the MDPSS are suitable bases for swallowing accelerometry signals.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#long-range-removal" class="off"><li>E.

Real data, obtained data from 408 healthy participants during various swallowing tasks, was used to analyze the processing accuracy with and without the spline-based head motions removal scheme. Specifically, we analyzed the segmentation accuracy and the effects of the scheme on statistical properties of these signals, as measured by the scaling analysis. The results of the numerical analysis showed that the spline-based technique achieves a superior performance in comparison to other existing techniques. Additionally, when applied to real data, we improved the accuracy of the segmentation process by achieving a 27 \% drop in the number of false negatives and a 30 \% drop in the number of false positives. Furthermore, the anthropometric trends in the statistical properties of these signals remained unaltered as shown by the scaling analysis, but the strength of statistical persistence was significantly reduced.

Various vibratory signal features and complementary measurement modalities have been put forth in the literature for the potential discrimination between safe and unsafe swallowing. To date, automatic classification of swallowing accelerometry has exclusively involved a single-axis of vibration although a second axis is known to contain additional information about the nature of the swallow. Furthermore, the only published attempt at automatic classification in adult patients has been based on a small sample of swallowing vibrations. Methods: In this paper, a large corpus of dual-axis accelerometric signals were collected from 30 older adults (aged 65.47 plus\minus 13.4 years, 15 male) referred to videofluoroscopic examination on the suspicion of dysphagia. We invoked a reputation-based classifier combination to automatically categorize the dual-axis accelerometric signals into safe and unsafe swallows, as labeled via videofluoroscopic review. From these participants, a total of 224 swallowing samples were obtained, 164 of which were labeled as unsafe swallows (swallows where the bolus entered the airway) and 60 as safe swallows. Three separate support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and eight different features were selected for classification. Results: With selected time, frequency and information theoretic features, the reputation-based algorithm distinguished between safe and unsafe swallowing with promising accuracy (80.48 plus\minus 5.0%), high sensitivity (97.1 plus\minus 2%) and modest specificity (64 plus\minus 8.8%). Interpretation of the most discriminatory features revealed that in general, unsafe swallows had lower mean vibration amplitude and faster autocorrelation decay, suggestive of decreased hyoid excursion and compromised coordination, respectively. Further, owing to its performance-based weighting of component classifiers, the static reputation-based algorithm outperformed the democratic majority voting algorithm on this clinical data set. Conclusions: Given its computational efficiency and high sensitivity, reputation-based classification of dual-axis accelerometry ought to be considered in future developments of a point-of-care swallow assessment where clinical informatics are desired.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#adhesion-molecules" class="off"><li>V.

We analyzed the relationship between serum soluble vascular and intercellular adhesion molecules (sVCAM, sICAM - markers of endothelial integrity), regional vasoreactivity and tissue volumes. Results: Diabetic subjects had greater vasoconstriction reactivity, more atrophy, depression and slower walking. Adhesion molecules were specifically related to gray matter atrophy (p=0.04) and altered vasoreactivity (p=0.03) in the diabetes and control groups. Regionally, sVCAM and sICAM were linked to exaggerated vasoconstriction, blunted vasodilatation and increased cortical atrophy in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes (p=0.04-0.003). sICAM correlated with worse functionality. Conclusions: Diabetes is associated with cortical atrophy, vasoconstriction and worse performance. Adhesion molecules, as markers of vascular health, have been indicated to contribute to altered vasoregulation and atrophy.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tcd-bci" class="off"><li>A.

However, the baseline signals, i.e., vibration signals with only quiet breathing or apnea but without swallowing, are not well understood. In particular, to comprehend the contaminant effects of head motion on cervical accelerometry, we need to study the scaling behavior of these baseline signals. Dual-axis accelerometry data were collected from 50 healthy adult participants under conditions of quiet breathing, apnea and selected head motions, all in the absence of swallowing. The denoised cervical vibrations were subjected to detrended fluctuation analysis with empirically determined first-order detrending. Strong persistence was identified in cervical vibration signals in both anterior–posterior (A–P) and superior–inferior (S–I) directions, under all the above experimental conditions. Vibrations in the A–P axes exhibited stronger correlations than those in the S–I axes, possibly as a result of axis-specific effects of vasomotion. In both axes, stronger correlations were found in the presence of head motion than without, suggesting that head movement significantly impacts baseline cervical accelerometry. No gender or age effects were found on statistical persistence of either vibration axes. Future developments of cervical accelerometry-based medical devices should actively mitigate the effects of head movement.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#fractional-fourier-transform" class="off"><li>E.

Specifically, the paper is geared toward signal processing practitioners by emphasizing the practical digital realizations and applications of the FRFT. It discusses three major topics. First, the manuscripts relates the FRFT to other mathematical transforms. Second, it discusses various approaches for practical realizations of the FRFT. Third, we overview the practical applications of the FRFT. From these discussions, we can clearly state that the FRFT is closely related to other mathematical transforms, such as time–frequency and linear canonical transforms. Nevertheless, we still feel that major contributions are expected in the field of the digital realizations and its applications, especially, since many digital realizations of the FRFT still lack properties of the continuous FRFT. Overall, the FRFT is a valuable signal processing tool. Its practical applications are expected to grow significantly in years to come, given that the FRFT offers many advantages over the traditional Fourier analysis.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mean-square-error" class="off"><li>S.

However, the literature suggests that variation in maneuver execution may threaten the effectiveness of the intervention. Our goal was to study variation in chin-down maneuver execution given a uniform instruction. Methods: Sagittal view digital video recordings were acquired from 408 healthy adults who performed sequences of reiterated water swallows in head-neutral and chin-down positions. Head angle measurements were extracted from the recordings, using markers on goggles worn by 176 participants. Results: We observed considerable variation in head angle in the head-neutral swallowing task, with a trend to greater flexion in participants over the age of 65. Male participants showed greater variation in head angle than females. Head flexion during the chin-down swallowing tasks averaged 19°, in the range reported to yield clinical benefit in radiographic studies. Conclusion: We conclude that a clear, uniform instruction is adequate to facilitate execution of the chin-down maneuver to a degree that is likely to be of clinical benefit. The variation in head angle observed in this study warrants further research, particularly regarding the relationship between anatomical cervical spine curvature and head angle influence on swallowing.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#treadmill-kids" class="off"><li>J.

The primary outcome measure was alpha, a quantifier of stride interval persistence obtained from detrended fluctuation analysis. Preferred walking speed, number of strides taken, stride interval duration, and stride interval coefficient of variation were also assessed. Stride interval persistence was significantly diminished during both treadmill walking conditions, compared to overground walking, with the largest decrease in alpha during UTW. Preferred speed, number of strides, and stride interval duration also differed between overground and treadmill walking, and older children demonstrated reduced stride interval variability compared to younger children. The observed treadmill and age effects on stride parameters may be due to a combination of differing locomotor constraints between overground and treadmill walking and developmental differences in sensory processing, cerebellar plasticity, and corticospinal involvement in locomotion.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#measures-of-dynamic-stability" class="off"><li>M.

Therefore, research on the measurement of dynamic stability has turned to other analysis methods such as stride interval dynamics and the maximum Lyapunov exponent. Stride interval dynamics reflect the statistical persistence of an individual’s stride interval time series and the Lyapunov exponent quantifies local dynamic stability – the sensitivity of the system to infinitesimal perturbations. In this study, we compare the ability of these measurement tools to detect changes between overground and compliant-surface walking, a condition known to affect stability, to determine their aptness as measures of dynamic stability. Fourteen able-bodied participants completed three 15 min walks, two overground and one on a compliant surface.

The results of DFA were then examined for potential influences of age, gender or body mass index. Several important conclusions were reached. First, the strongest persistence was observed for the wet chin tuck swallows. Second, the vibrations in the superior–inferior (S–I) direction generally have stronger temporal dependencies than those in the anterior–posterior (A–P) direction. Both of these phenomena can be attributed to the dominating influence of head movements on the amplitude of vibrations in the S–I direction. Third, gender, age and body mass index of the participants did not impact the observed persistence for dry and wet chin tuck swallows, while a gender effect was identified for wet swallows. In particular, male participants experienced more Brownian-like statistical dependencies in their swallowing signals. Future developments in the field should attempt to remove signal components associated with strong statistical persistence, as they tend to be associated with non-swallowing phenomena.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#head-movements-cervical" class="off"><li>E.

A complete understanding of the effects of head motion is required before a robust accelerometry-based medical device can be developed. In this paper, we examine the spectral characteristics of dual-axis cervical accelerometry signals in the absence of swallowing but in the presence of head motions. Findings: Data from 50 healthy adults were collected while participants performed five different head motions. Three different spectral features were extracted from each recording: peak frequency, spectral centroid and bandwidth. Statistical analyses showed that peak frequencies are independent of the type of head motion, participant gender and age. However, spectral centroids are statistically different between the anterior-posterior (A-P) and superior-inferior (S-I) directions and between different motion. Additionally, statistically different bandwidths are observed for head tilts down and back between the A-P and the S-I directions. Conclusions: These differences indicate that head motions induce additional non-dominant spectral components in dual-axis cervical recordings. The results presented here suggest that head motion ought to be considered in the development of medical devices based on dual-axis cervical accelerometery signals.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#vocalization-removal" class="off"><li>E.

Given the propagative properties of MMG signals, it has been suggested that MMG classification should be robust to changes in sensor placement. Nonetheless, this purported robustness remains speculative to date. This study sought to quantify the change in classification accuracy, if any, when a classifier trained with MMG signals from the muscle belly, is subsequently tested with MMG signals from a nearby location. Methods: An arrangement of 5 accelerometers was attached to the flexor carpi radialis muscle of 12 able-bodied participants; a reference accelerometer was located over the muscle belly, two peripheral accelerometers were positioned along the muscle's transverse axis and two more were aligned to the muscle's longitudinal axis. Participants performed three classes of muscle activity: wrist flexion, wrist extension and semi-pronation. A collection of time, frequency and time-frequency features were considered and reduced by genetic feature selection. The classifier, trained using features from the reference accelerometer, was tested with signals from the longitudinally and transversally displaced accelerometers. Results: Classification degradation due to accelerometer displacement was significant for all participants, and showed no consistent trend with the direction of displacement. Further, the displaced accelerometer signals showed task-dependent de-correlations with respect to the reference accelerometer. Conclusions: These results indicate that MMG signal features vary with spatial location and that accelerometer displacements of only 1-2 cm cause sufficient feature drift to significantly diminish classification accuracy. This finding emphasizes the importance of consistent sensor placement between MMG classifier training and deployment for accurate control of switching interfaces.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tfr-swallowing-signals" class="off"><li>I.

In addition, modeling of a data acquisition system was performed to annul any undesired instrumentation effects. Two independent data collection procedures were conducted to fulfil the goals of the study. For baseline characterization, data were acquired from 50 healthy adult subjects. To model the data acquisition (DAQ) system, ten recordings were obtained while the system was exposed to random small vibrations. The inverse filtering approach removed extraneous effects introduced by the DAQ system. Approximately half of the filtered signals were stationary in nature. All signals exhibited a level of statistical dependence between the two axes. Also, there were very low frequency oscillations present in these signals that may be attributable to vasomotion of blood vessels near the thyroid cartilage, blood flow, and respiration. Demographic variables such as age and gender did not statistically influence baseline information-theoretic signal characteristics. However, participant age did affect the baseline spectral characteristics.

Methods: Eight able-bodied participants were subjected to conditions that would cause a change in EDA: music imagery, startling noises, and deep inspirations. A user-centered cardiorespiratory classifier consisting of 1) an EDR detector, 2) a respiratory filter and 3) a cardiorespiratory filter was developed to automatically detect a participant's EDRs and to classify the origin of their stimulation as voluntary or involuntary. Results: Detected EDRs were classified with a positive predictive value of 78%, a negative predictive value of 81% and an overall accuracy of 78%. Without the classifier, EDRs could only be correctly attributed as voluntary or involuntary with an accuracy of 50%. Conclusions: The proposed classifier may enable investigators to form more accurate interpretations of electrodermal activity as a measure of an individual's psychophysiological state.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#various-liquid-stimuli" class="off"><li>J.

Although swallowing is known to be physiologically modifiable by the type of food or liquid (i.e., stimuli), the effects of stimuli on dual-axis accelerometry signals have never been thoroughly investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate stimulus effects on dual-axis accelerometry signal characteristics. Signals were acquired from 17 healthy participants while swallowing 4 different stimuli: water, nectar-thick and honey-thick apple juices, and a thin-liquid barium suspension. Two swallowing tasks were examined: discrete and sequential. A variety of features were extracted in the time and time-frequency domains after swallow segmentation and pre-processing. A separate Friedman test was conducted for each feature and for each swallowing task. Results: Significant main stimulus effects were found on 6 out of 30 features for the discrete task and on 5 out of 30 features for the sequential task. Analysis of the features with significant stimulus effects suggested that the changes in the signals revealed slower and more pronounced swallowing patterns with increasing bolus viscosity. Conclusions: We conclude that stimulus type does affect specific characteristics of dual-axis swallowing accelerometry signals, suggesting that associated clinical screening protocols may need to be stimulus specific.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#correlation-between-energy-and-alpha" class="off"><li>J.

Since human locomotion is shaped by energy efficient movements, it has been hypothesized that stride interval dynamics and energy expenditure may be inherently tied, both having demonstrated similar sensitivities to age, disease, and pace-constrained walking. Findings: This study tested for correlations between stride interval persistence and measures of energy expenditure including mass-specific gross oxygen consumption per minute, mass-specific gross oxygen cost per meter (VO2) and heart rate (HR). Metabolic and stride interval data were collected from 30 asymptomatic children who completed one 10-minute walking trial under each of the following conditions: (i) overground walking, (ii) hands-free treadmill walking, and (iii) handrail-supported treadmill walking. Stride interval persistence was not significantly correlated with (p > 0.32), VO2 (p > 0.18) or HR (p > 0.56). Conclusions: No simple linear dependence exists between stride interval persistence and measures of gross energy expenditure in asymptomatic children when walking overground and on a treadmill.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#robust-st" class="off"><li>E.

Thus, recent investigations have focused on quantifying this scaling behavior in order to gain insight into locomotor control. While the ability of a given analysis technique to provide an accurate scaling estimate depends largely on the stationary properties of the given series, direct investigation of stride interval stationarity has been largely overlooked. In the present study we test the stride interval time series obtained from able-bodied children for weak stationarity. Specifically, we analyze signals obtained during three distinct modes of self-paced locomotion: (i) overground walking, (ii) unsupported (hands-free) treadmill walking, and (iii) handrail-supported treadmill walking. Using the reverse arrangements test, we identify non-stationary signals in all three walking conditions and find the major known cause to be due to time-varying first and second moments. We further discuss our findings in terms of locomotor control and the differences between the locomotor modalities investigated. Overall, our results advocate against scaling analysis techniques that assume stationarity.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#denoising-swallowing-signals" class="off"><li>E.

These signals however can be very noisy as a result of physiological and motion artifacts. In this note, we propose a novel scheme for denoising those signals, i.e. a computationally efficient search for the optimal denoising threshold within a reduced wavelet subspace. To determine a viable subspace, the algorithm relies on the minimum value of the estimated upper bound for the reconstruction error. A numerical analysis of the proposed scheme using synthetic test signals demonstrated that the proposed scheme is computationally more efficient than minimum noiseless description length (MNDL)-based denoising. It also yields smaller reconstruction errors than MNDL, SURE and Donoho denoising methods. When applied to dual-axis swallowing accelerometry signals, the proposed scheme exhibits improved performance for dry, wet and wet chin tuck swallows.

Natural variations in chin tuck angles across individuals may contribute to the differential effectiveness of the technique. Methodology: To facilitate the study of chin tuck angle variations, we present a template tracking algorithm that automatically extracts neck angles from sagittal videos of individuals performing chin tuck swallows. Three yellow markers geometrically arranged on a pair of dark visors were used as tracking cues. Results: The algorithm was applied to data collected from 178 healthy participants during neutral and chin tuck position swallows. Our analyses revealed no major influences of body mass index and age on neck flexion angles during swallowing, while gender influenced the average neck angle only during wet swallows in the neutral position. Chin tuck angles seem to be independent of anthropometry and gender in healthy adults, but deserve further study in pathological populations. Conclusion: The proposed neck flexion angle extraction algorithm may be useful in future studies where strict participant compliance to swallowing task protocol can be assured.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#swallowing-segmentation" class="off"><li>E.

Individuals with dysphagia are prone to aspiration (the entry of foreign material into the airway), which directly increases the risk of serious respiratory consequences such as pneumonia. Swallowing accelerometry is a promising noninvasive tool for the detection of aspiration and the evaluation of swallowing. In this paper, dual-axis accelerometry was implemented since the motion of the hyolaryngeal complex occurs in both anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions during swallowing. Dual-axis cervical accelerometry signals were acquired from 408 healthy subjects during dry, wet, and wet chin tuck swallowing tasks. The proposed segmentation algorithm is based on the idea of sequential fuzzy partitioning of the signal and is well suited for long signals with nonstationary variance. The algorithm was validated with simulated signals with known swallowing locations and a subset of 295 real swallows manually segmented by an experienced speech language pathologist. In both cases, the algorithm extracted individual swallows with over 90% accuracy. The time duration analysis was carried out with respect to gender, body mass index (BMI), and age. Demographic and anthropometric variables influenced the duration of these segmented signals. Male participants exhibited longer swallows than female participants (p=0.05). Older participants and participants with higher BMIs exhibited swallows with significantly longer (p=0.05) duration than younger participants and those with lower BMIs, respectively.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tfr-review" class="off"><li>E.

Traditional signal processing approaches assume the stationarity of signals, which in practice is not often satisfied. Hence, time or frequency descriptions alone are insufficient to provide comprehensive information about such signals. On the contrary, time–frequency analysis is more suitable for nonstationary signals. Therefore, this paper provides a status report of feature based signal processing in the time–frequency domain through an overview of recent contributions. The feature considered here is energy concentration. The paper provides an analysis of several classes of feature extractors, i.e., time–frequency representations, and feature classifiers. The results of the literature review indicate that time–frequency domain signal processing using energy concentration as a feature is a very powerful tool and has been utilized in numerous applications. The expectation is that further research and applications of these algorithms will flourish in the near future.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#if-estimation-scalogram" class="off"><li>E.
