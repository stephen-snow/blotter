Currently utilized techniques to screen for this condition are questionably reliable and are often deployed in non-standard manners, so efforts have been put forth to generate an instrumental alternative based on cervical auscultation. These physiological signals with low signal-to-noise ratios are traditionally denoised by well-known wavelets in a discrete, single tree wavelet decomposition. We attempt to improve this widely accepted method by designing a matched wavelet for cervical auscultation signals to provide better denoising capabilities and by implementing a dual-tree complex wavelet transform to maintain time invariant properties of this filtering. We found that our matched wavelet did offer better denoising capabilities for cervical auscultation signals compared to several popular wavelets and that the dual tree complex wavelet transform did offer better time invariance when compared to the single tree structure. We conclude that this new method of denoising cervical auscultation signals could benefit applications that can spare the required computation time and complexity.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="media"><div class="media-body"><div class="smallhead media-heading"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#adaptive-power-implantable-device" class="off">K.

Wireless powering of and communication with implanted devices is possible through wireless transcutaneous energy transfer. However, designing wireless transcutaneous systems is complicated due to the variability of the environment. The focus of this review is on strategies to sense and adapt to environmental variations in wireless transcutaneous systems. Adaptive systems provide the ability to maintain performance in the face of both unpredictability (variation from expected parameters) and variability (changes over time). Current strategies in adaptive (or tunable) systems include sensing relevant metrics to evaluate the function of the system in its environment and adjusting control parameters according to sensed values through the use of tunable components. Some challenges of applying adaptive designs to implantable devices are challenges common to all implantable devices, including size and power reduction on the implant, efficiency of power transfer and safety related to energy absorption in tissue. Challenges specifically associated with adaptation include choosing relevant and accessible parameters to sense and adjust, minimizing the tuning time and complexity of control, utilizing feedback from the implanted device and coordinating adaptation at the transmitter and receiver.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="media"><div class="media-body"><div class="smallhead media-heading"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#aca-tcd-cognitive-tasks" class="off">H.

Methods: In this study, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) was insonated on both sides, that is, right ACA (R-ACA) and left ACA (L-ACA). The envelope signals (the maximum velocity) and the raw signals were analyzed during cognitive processes, i.e. word-generation tasks, geometric tasks and resting state periods separating each task. Data which were collected from 20 healthy participants were used to investigate the changes and the hemispheric functioning while performing cognitive tasks. Signal characteristics were analyzed in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Results: Significant results have been obtained through the use of both classic/modern methods (i.e. envelope/raw, time and frequency/information-theoretic and time-frequency domains). The frequency features extracted from the raw signals highlighted sex effects on cerebral blood flow which revealed distinct brain response during each process and during resting periods. In the time-frequency analysis, the distribution of wavelet energies on the envelope signals moved around the low frequencies during mental processes and did not experience any lateralization during cognitive tasks. Conclusions: Even if no lateralization effects were noticed during resting-state, verbal and geometric tasks, understanding CBFV in ACA during cognitive tasks could complement information extracted from cerebral blood flow in middle cerebral arteries during similar cognitive tasks (i.e. sex effects).</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="media"><div class="media-body"><div class="smallhead media-heading"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cervical-auscultation-unsafe-airway-protection" class="off">J.

This event can lead to short-term harm via airway obstruction or more long-term effects such as pneumonia. In order to non-invasively identify this event using high resolution cervical auscultation there is a need to characterize cervical auscultation signals from subjects with dysphagia who aspirate. Methods: In this study, we collected swallowing sound and vibration data from 76 adults (50 men, 26 women, mean age 62) who underwent a routine videofluoroscopy swallowing examination. The analysis was limited to swallows of liquid with either thin (less than 5 cps) or viscous (around 300 cps) consistency and was divided into those with deep laryngeal penetration or aspiration (unsafe airway protection), and those with either shallow or no laryngeal penetration (safe airway protection), using a standardized scale. After calculating a selection of time, frequency, and time-frequency features for each swallow, the safe and unsafe categories were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical tests. Results: Our analysis found that few of our chosen features varied in magnitude between safe and unsafe swallows with thin swallows demonstrating no statistical variation. We also supported our past findings with regard to the effects of sex and the presence or absence of stroke on cervical ausculation signals, but noticed certain discrepancies with regards to bolus viscosity. Conclusions: Overall, our results support the necessity of using multiple statistical features concurrently to identify laryngeal penetration of swallowed boluses in future work with high resolution cervical auscultation.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="media"><div class="media-body"><div class="smallhead media-heading"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#heart-rate-stroke-outcome" class="off">A.

The secondary objective of this paper was to determine whether HRV shows a strong association with the motor outcome 3 months after stroke in individuals with severe initial motor impairments. METHODS: We recruited 13 patients with acute stroke from an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. A Holter monitor was placed upon admission and Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Subscales were used to assess the movement of the affected upper and lower extremities 3 months after admission. The standard deviation of R-R intervals was used to quantify HRV. RESULTS: A Spearman rank correlation revealed a strong positive and significant correlation between HRV upon admission and movement of the affected upper extremity (r=.70, P=.01) and affected lower extremity (r=.60, P=.03) at 3 months. For patients with severe initial motor impairments, HRV showed a strong positive association with the movement of the affected upper (r=.61, P=.04) and lower (r=.70, P=.04) extremities at 3 months. CONCLUSION: HRV is strongly associated with motor outcome after stroke and provides a promising marker to explore the mechanisms associated with motor recovery after stroke.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="media"><div class="media-body"><div class="smallhead media-heading"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#menopausal-hot-flashes-and-white-matter-hyperintensities" class="off">R.

Emerging data link hot flashes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet whether hot flashes are related to brain health is poorly understood. We examined the relationship between hot flashes (measured via physiologic monitor and self-report) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) among midlife women. Methods: Twenty midlife women (aged 40-60 y) without clinical CVD, with an intact uterus and ovaries, and not taking hormone therapy were recruited. Women underwent 24 hours of ambulatory physiologic and diary hot flash monitoring to quantify hot flashes; magnetic resonance imaging to assess WMH burden; 72 hours of actigraphy to quantify sleep; and a blood draw, questionnaires, and physical measures to quantify demographics and CVD risk factors. Tests of a priori hypotheses regarding relationships between physiologically monitored and self-reported wake and sleep hot flashes and WMH were conducted in linear regression models. Results: More physiologically monitored hot flashes during sleep were associated with greater WMH, controlling for age, race, and body mass index ([beta] [SE] = 0.0002 [0.0001], P = 0.03]. Findings persisted after controlling for sleep characteristics and additional CVD risk factors. No relationships were observed for self-reported hot flashes. Conclusions: More physiologically monitored hot flashes during sleep are associated with greater WMH burden among midlife women without clinical CVD. Results suggest that the relationship between hot flashes and CVD risk observed in the periphery may extend to the brain. Future work should consider the unique role of sleep hot flashes in brain health.</p></div><div class="spacer"></div></div><div id="footer"><span style="display:none">foo</span></div></body></html>
