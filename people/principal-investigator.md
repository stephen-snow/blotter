Ervin holds a B.E. Sc. and Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario, both in electrical engineering. During his undergraduate studies, Ervin specialized in wireless communications, while his Ph.D. project focused on signal processing. From 2008 until 2010, Ervin was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto with a cross-appointment at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Canada’s largest children’s rehabilitation teaching hospital. During his postdoctoral fellowship, Ervin focused on rehabilitation engineering and biomedical instrumentation. He was also a research fellow in medicine at Harvard Medical School cross-appointed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (July 2010-June 2011), where he focused on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular monitoring of older/diabetic adults.

Ervin shares Pitt’s passion for discovery and innovation. From his earliest exposure to research, he has been driven to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge through carefully-executed experiments and ground-breaking published work. Ervin's respect for credible and valid research fuels his constant endeavours to connect advances in signal processing and instrumentation to some of society’s greatest challenges, particularly in the biomedical field. In February 2016, President Obama named Ervin as a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, “…the highest honor bestowed by the United States Government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers.” In 2017, Ervin was awarded the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, which is the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of the career-development activities of those scholars who most effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their organization.

Ervin is also committed to excellence in education and has always strived to guide and motivate students to fully understand the fundamental principles of applied sciences. He also pay considerable attention to providing students with a learning environment that stimulates collaborative discussions.
