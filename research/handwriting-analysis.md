Handwriting and drawing are skills that we learn at the early age. It’s easy to take them for granted, and we don’t often think about them as skills that can be used to detect or assess neurological disorders. However, analyzing handwriting/drawing tasks can lead to many new potential details about a patient’s condition. A major drawback to this current technique is that the results are subjectively assessed by clinicians, causing many different opinions about the patient’s condition.

We aim to quantify the changes in handwriting/drawing tasks due to different experimental conditions and/or health conditions. This can be achieved by using readily available sensors and tablets. Our goal is to introduce a multimodal assessment of handwriting/drawing tasks to a clinical community in order to potentially speed up the diagnostic process of neurological disorders, but also to provide a valuable assessment tool.
