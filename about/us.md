title: About Us
---

The iMED (Innovative Medical Engineering Developments) lab was founded in 2011 through the generous support of the Swanson School of Engineering and the University of Pittsburgh. The vision of this lab is to become an international leader in dynamical biomarkers indicative of age- and disease-related changes and their contributions to functional decline under normal and pathological conditions. In particular, the mission of the lab is to develop clinically relevant solutions by fostering innovation in computational approaches and instrumentation that can be translated to bedside care.

Given the vision and mission behind the lab, our motto is: "Output and outcome." These two simple words fully describe the essence of the lab. "Output" describes the first goal of the iMED lab: to conduct rigorous scientific investigations whose results will be published in respected high impact journals. In order to achieve this goal, we strive to conduct cutting-edge research projects which produce results with an immediate impact. "Outcome" describes the second goal of the iMED lab: to conduct research projects that matter to patients and the public. In other words, our research must make a difference in people's lives. The research conducted in the iMED lab must lead to important and real-life relevant advances in biomedical computational approaches and instrumentation.

The iMED lab serves as a unique, clinically oriented training ground for undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows interested in computational tools and instrumentation. We work very closely alongside numerous health and allied health professionals and scientists, including physicians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech language pathologists, throughout all stages of research, from problem formulation to grant application, from data collection to journal publication.
